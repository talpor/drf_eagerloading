Usage
=====
There are 2 steps to use DRF EagerLoading:

**First:** In the desired serializer you will need to use the `EagerLoadingSerializerMixin`::

    from drf_eagerloading.mixins import EagerLoadingSerializerMixin
    class MyModelSerializer(EagerLoadingSerializerMixin, serializers.ModelSerializer):
        # Add the prefetch and select related fields
        select_related_fields = ("my_select_field",)
        prefetch_related_fields = ("my_prefetch_field",)

Note: when to use `select_related_fields` and `prefetch_related_fields`?
Quick response: same as before!!

- `select_related_fields`: one_to_one and many_to_many relations
- `prefetch_related_fields`: many_to_many and one_to_many relations

**Second:** In the desired view you will need to use the `EagerLoadingViewSetMixin`::

    from drf_eagerloading.mixins import EagerLoadingViewSetMixin
    class MyModelViewSet(EagerLoadingViewSetMixin, viewsets.ModelViewSet):
        queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
